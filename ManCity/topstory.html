<p>Sergio Aguero says City’s continued learning in the Champions League will pay dividends sooner rather than later.</p>
</div>



<div class="txt">
<p>The Blues’ record goal-scorer admits the Champions League is the one major success missing from his CV and that he’d love to bring Europe’s most coveted club trophy back to the Etihad.</p>
<p>Victory over Atalanta on Wednesday would guarantee the Blues’ passage to the Round of 16 with two games still to play and Aguero believes City, who have reached the quarter-final twice and semi-final once, are improving with each European campaign.</p>
<p>
	“So far, it’s the one thing I haven’ won with City,” said Aguero.

<p>“We’ll keep up the fight. All of these years have been a learning experience and we intend to continue that this season.</p>
<p>“City hadn’t been able to participate in Europe it for quite some time, and now we are able to be a challenge every season.</p>
<p>“Each campaign, we acquire more experience. Of course, I’d be very happy to win the Champions League with City and I really hope it’s on the cards.”</p>
<p>The Blues are trying for a third successive Premier League title this year and Aguero believes it is possible to win both the league and Champions League in the same season – though it is a huge task for any English club.</p>

<p>“I’ve always said, the Premier League is the most competitive national tournament of them all, and if you intend to win it, you need to keep a steady stride, so to speak.</p>
<p>“For the past two years, we’ve been able to conquer it in different ways - once, with a generous lead over our nearest challengers and once with the bare minimum of breathing room!</p>
<p>“The last season proved just how tough a challenge it is. Perhaps right now it’s hard to absorb what we’ve achieved domestically over the past few years, but as time goes on, it will become clearer.</p>
<p>“These are some of the reasons why it’s hard to win the Premier League and the Champion League</p>
<p>For the Premier League, consistency throughout a long period of time is required, though you have some margin to recover from a setback.</p>
<p>“The Champions League doesn’t offer that - and it’s even less forgiving in the knock-out stages, as the decisive factor for each round can come down to technicalities and the rub of the green.</p>
<p>“Our last experience against Tottenham is a testament to that.”</p>
